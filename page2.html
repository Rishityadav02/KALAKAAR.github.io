                    <p>Ceramic artist Betsy Gomez has been doing pottery since 2017. From miniatures to wall decors, this Bangalore-based Malayali artist’s one-year-old brand ‘Kaaka Pottery’ offers a varied collection of products to uplift your living space.Before trying out pottery, Betsy, a design graduate from NIFT Bangalore, was always fascinated by ancient craft. Soon after her graduation, Betsy followed her calling and decided to give the handmade craft a shot.<br> After undergoing training as an intern at a studio in Thrissur, she became a trainer at a community space in Bengaluru. The 26-year-old was gradually carving her niche over the years. The pandemic pushed her to explore her boundaries further, and Betsy gave a new dimension to her inherent skills by launching her home-grown brand Kaaka Pottery in 2020</p>
